                    <p>Featuring striking, striped foliage, Ctenanthe Burle-Marxii [ten-AN-thee] is an interesting houseplant and perfect for rooms without direct sun. As an evergreen plant, the leaves remain on display throughout the year. It is part of the Maranta family (Maranta leuconeura prayer plant) and native to Brazil and also an easy-care plant. Ctenanthe Burle-Marxii is named after the famous Brazilian artist and landscape designer – Roberto Burle Marx, who I had the pleasure of once meeting. </p>
                    <p>The Burle-Marxii Calathea plant goes by several other identities: Stromanthe amabilis, Calathea amabilis, Calathea Burle-Marxii, Fishbone prayer plant. Due to the region where this plant comes from in South America, it grows best in humid conditions. Calathea is recommended for USDA hardiness zones 10 to 12, for outdoor growth. Outside of these zones, grow the plant indoors or in a greenhouse. It is a slow-growing plant and may take two seasons to reach its full height.</p>
                    <p>The leaves grow in fan-like clusters and may reach up to 12″ inches in length. The leaves are the most interesting feature of this plant. The striped, fishbone pattern is dark green on top of the light, gray-green leaves. The underside of the Ctenanthe Burle-Marxii leaves is often red or grayish. While Ctenanthe Burle-Marxii plants are not known for their flowers, they do produce clusters appearing at the ends of long stalks that reach through the thick foliage. The flowers do not produce a fragrance and typically bloom in the winter or early spring. The tiny white flowers rarely grow longer than half an inch and produce cherry-red bracts.</p>

                    <p>Monstera deliciosa, commonly called split-leaf philodendron, is native to Central America. It is a climbing, evergreen perennial vine that is perhaps most noted for its large perforated leaves on thick plant stems and its long cord-like aerial roots. In its native tropical habitat, it will climb somewhat impressively to 70’ into large trees, clothing the trunks with leaves in the 1-3’ long range. Indoor plants more typically are grown in the 6-8’ range. Mature leaves of this plant are very large, glossy, deep green and distinctively cut and perforated. Juvenile leaves are small and mostly uncut. Mature plants may produce arum-like flowers with a spadix to 10” surrounded by a white spathe.</p>
                    <p>Flowers give way to an edible fruit that is reminiscent in taste to pineapple-banana. Indoor plants rarely flower and fruit however. Aerial roots on the lower parts of this plant can be rooted into the soil to help nourish the plant. Aerial roots on the upper parts of the plant can be attached to a moss-like climbing pole or simply removed.Genus name possibly contracted from monstrifer meaning monster-bearing in reference to the perforated leaves. Specific epithet means delicious for the delicious, edible fruit. Common name is in reference to the perforated foliage. Although not a philodendron, this plant is commonly called split-leaf philodendron. No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, mealybugs, thrips, scale or spider mites.</p>
